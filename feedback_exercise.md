## Comments 

- Parallel coordinate system for the line chart
> We think that this helps us compare multiple stations (a lot of stations) at once, but we're still not sure how exactly we would want to handle this.
- Line chart gers highlihgted with the rest of the tube (for the tube map)
> This means to pull out the line we chose, and also dim the rest of the tube. We think this is a valuable addition to what we had planned. We plan on doing this by dimming the rest of the map, while highlighing the selected one and straightening it (our original plan) at the same time.
- Add more filters by year (for the line-by-line design)
> We were originally going to do this, but now we are definitely going to do this.
- Add tool tips on years to filter out some of the noise (for the line-by-line design)
> To achieve this, we will only show one catagory at a time, but display a tool tip containing all the data for this year when we hover over said year on the graph.
- Stacked bar charts for comparing stations together would look better
> We dislike this idea. It's not very meaningful to use stacked bar charts, especially when we have categorical data. Probably not going to implement this.
- Handle case when user selects all stations, do :
  - Parallel coordinates
  > See above
  - Brushing on the straight line chart to see groups of stations compared on a parallel coordinate system
  > See above
- Another idea would be highlighting slelected stations on the underlying map
> Helps for clarity. We will be adding this to the list of must haves.

## Our Thoughts

We thought that having another group look over our designs was helpful and fair. Most of the comments they provided are going to be added to our core project, and the ones that didn't make it were still of good quality.
