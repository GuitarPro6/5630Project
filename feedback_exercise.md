> This is an inline quote
- Line chart gers highlihgted with the rest of the tube
- Add more filters by year
- Add tool tips on years to filter out some of the noise
- Stacked bar charts for comparing stations together would look better
- Handle case when user selects all stations, do :
  - Parallel coordinates
  - Brushing on the straight line chart to see groups of stations compared on a parallel coordinate system
- Another idea would be highlighting slelected stations on the underlying map
