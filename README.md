Visualization of London Underground


In this project I am looking to make a visualization of the London Underground with aggregate, line, and station data obtained from the TFL (Transport For London) API website. The idea is to show interesting trends that have occured over time in the entry/exit information as well as highlight data obtained in 2016 on demographic/origin&destination information from each station. 

The map of the London Underground is one of my favorite visualizations just as an abstraction of irrelevant information in and of itself.

After returning from working in London over the summer and experiencing the Tube and how user friendly it is compared to other metros in Europe I looked into what kind of data is available about it. Come to find out that the TFL has very accurate data that they make public as well as put on their API for developers. I want to use this data and take advantage of the unique structure of the Tube map to explore this landscape. 

I also had some inspiration from other developers that have made incredible visualizations off the Oyster card data such as the animation 'day on the tube' where time, entry, and exit information are uitilzed to show people as dots riding the tube on the map.
